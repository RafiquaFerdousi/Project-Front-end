Variables and Data Types:
Variables are used to store data in JavaScript. There are several types of data types in JavaScript, including string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and object.

var a = 2;
a++
a+=12
a-+1
let b = 1;
const pi =3.14;

console.log (a);
console.log ("begin");

var myName = "John";
var age = 30;
var isMarried = true;
var car = null;
var pet; // undefined
var person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isMarried: true
};

Functions:
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They can take arguments and return values.

function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
console.log(addNumbers(5, 7)); // 12

function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
greet("John"); // Hello, John!

Conditional Statements:
Conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

var age = 30;
if (age < 18) {
  console.log("You are not old enough to vote.");
} else if (age >= 18 && age < 25) {
  console.log("You can vote, but you can't rent a car.");
} else {
  console.log("You can vote and rent a car.");
}

Loops:
Loops are used to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met.

var i;
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

var j = 0;
while (j < 5) {
  console.log(j);
  j++;
}


Events:
JavaScript can also be used to handle user events, such as clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs.

document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});

document.addEventListener("keydown", function(event) {
  console.log("Key pressed: " + event.key);
});
